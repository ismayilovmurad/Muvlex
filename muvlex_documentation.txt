About -
I like watching movies, tv shows almost every day. 
But unfortunately, I feel something deficiency every time when I finish watching. 
I think we like to discuss something, give ratings, and take other people's opinions about that particular field. 
I've searched and found no app or website about social media for cinephiles. (If there's one don't hesitate and suggest me in the comments section) 
Yes, there's a lot of Facebook, Telegram groups about movies but I think it's not enough. So I decided to build a social media app for Cinephiles like me.
It's not a perfect app but we can improve the app if you keep helping, suggesting new features, or reporting me bugs. 
You can rate a movie and tell your thoughts about a movie, comment&like other people's ratings, keep collect your watched movies, 
tv shows in your profile section so you can find the movie or tv shows you watched.
I hope you'll find the app useful. Don't forget to review the app after using it so I can improve. You can download the app from the link in the bio.

You can find your soulmate here.
